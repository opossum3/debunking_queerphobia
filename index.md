# About
{: .no_toc }
## This is a static site with the goal to debunk myths, fearmongering, and pseudoscience about queer people.
{: .no_toc }

By queer people I mean all people who due to their sex characteristics or harmless attraction(s) are not considered typical (hence "queer") by today's society, including:
* Gay and lesbian people
* Bi (including pan, omni, and poly) people
* Transgender (including non-binary) people
* Intersex people
* Asexual and aromantic people

The same group of people is also described as LGBT+ or other derivatives of it, but I decided against it as it commonly leads to either exclusionism or the acronym getting endlessly long (e.g. LGBTQIAA2S...).
"Queer" may have a history of being used as a slur against LGBT+ people, but it's the most frequently preferred and the third most accepted according to [this 2018 survey](https://qesurvey.tumblr.com/post/173556136743/what-is-the-ranking-of-various-acronyms-for-the)

Those who don't prefer this term [tend to be - among other things - exclusionists](https://qesurvey.tumblr.com/post/172970586838/how-do-different-identities-accept-and-reject-the) [(archive link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210228030528/https://qesurvey.tumblr.com/post/172970586838/how-do-different-identities-accept-and-reject-the).
 
This is not to say that anyone who uses the term LGBT+ is an exclusionist, as plenty of non-exclusionist people use it (including me), alongside other terms. I'm just proving my point about one of the downsides of LGBT+ acronyms being that they give exclusionists rhetorical ammunition. It's also unclear how representative the surveys I've found are, but I couldn't find any other ones  that document as many details, such as self-identification with exclusionism.

## Site structure 

I structured this site by dividing various groups into their own main sections (e.g. "Trans Rights!") and then the direct replies to certain myths being categorized vaguely 
by what they're about.
If you can't seem to find a certain myth being addressed through these categories, try searching keywords in the search bar. 
If you still can't find it, but think it is an important myth to be addressed here, you can write me.

## Sources

All sources are cited directly where their content is discussed. Studies link to their DOI (digital objective identifier; permanent links) whenever possible. Articles & studies with no DOI have a link to their original source (website, journal) and an additional archive link in case the original link breaks or changes it's content.

The following resources greatly helped me with adding more sources for the counter-arguments and also made me aware of some reactionary arguments I hadn't encountered before:
