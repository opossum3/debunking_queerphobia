## "Trans people are delusional."

Trans people are claiming they feel as though they ought to be a different sex. A claim about ones own feelings by definition cannot be delusional, because a delusion is a belief contrary to objective evidence. But ones own feelings cannot be objectively determined by anyone but oneself.

There is a common misconception that trans people are claiming they are a certain sex which they are not. However, trans people are usually painfully aware of how they do not have their desired sex, that corresponds to their gender. The definition of "trans" itself references this and it's the whole reason why trans people often medically transition. During and after medical transition they, [objectively, become an intermediate sex](!!!). 

Nobody is claiming that trans people are a different sex before medical transition. The claim is merely that they should be socially treated as a different gender even before or without medical transition to improve their mental health and not trigger gender dysphoria - a recognized condition.

## "Gender identity doesn't exist"

#### Gender identity proven by cis people

Most cis people openly state that they feel they do have a gender identity:
- A study by [Joel. et. al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19419899.2013.830640) ([pdf link](https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/daphnajoel/files/2014/11/Joel_gender_identity_2013.pdf), [archive link of the pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20210425120153/https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/daphnajoel/files/2014/11/Joel_gender_identity_2013.pdf)) surveyed Israeli cis individuals of different sexual orientations and trans people. It found that most cis people also have a sense of gender identity. It also found that ambiguous feelings towards gender are more common among cis people and less correlated to sexual orientation than often presumed. 
	- The results have been replicated in [Joel & Jacobson (2018)](doi.org/10.1007/s10508-018-1239-y) and [Joel & Jacobson (2019)]( https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2018.1523998) with English-speaking participants.
	- This also shows that cis people's relationships with gender significantly vary within the group, like with trans people, though not to the same degree. This could be explained through different social circumstances, discrimination, etc. and doesn't necessarily mean trans and cis people are inherently differnt in their understanding of gender.

If gender identity didn't exist, no cis person would ever feel anything comparable to gender incongruence or gender dysphoria if they live or appear as a different gender than assigned, and yet they do.

- Amanda Bynes is an actress who starred in the 2006 movie "She's the man" as a girl who impersonates her twin brother. She says this was "a super strange and out-of-body experience" which even caused her depression. ([Ahlgrim, 2018](https://www.insider.com/amanda-bynes-paper-magazine-interview-depression-shes-the-man-2018-11) - URL excluded from Wayback Machine). This indicates she has a female gender identity that prevents her from comfortably appearing and living as male.
- Norah Vincent went undercover as a man for a year to write a book called "Self-Made Man". She ended up so depressed and out of touch with reality (gender dysphoria) [that she checked herself in into a psychiatric hospital.](http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1868983,00.html) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200219104300/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1868983,00.html))
- Some cis people mistakenly believe they are trans and medically transition, but then realize it alienated them further from their bodies. This indicates that they originally had a gender identity that has now been misaligned with their bodies artificially and of which they cannot simply get rid of or ignore to be comfortable in their new, transitioned bodies. They usually detransition. _(Note, however, [that this number of people is really low](!!!), in most representative studies way less than 1%.)_

#### Gender identity proven by forcibly re-assigned cis people

In some cases, children are surgically re-assigned to another sex before they can give consent. They are raised almost entirely as their new gender. This harmful practice is often perfomed on visibly intersex children.

Despite growing up as their re-assigned sex, they are much more likely to later transition back to their initially assigned sex due to feeling wrong in their re-assigned sex. This would make no sense if there was no such thing as an innate gender identity that demands a congruent body; that makes additional, exhausting medical procedures preferrable to remaining in their current, re-assigned bodies.

- [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) was an [endosex](! "not intersex") cis man who underwent genital mutilation at 22 months to re-assign him and raise as female, after his circumcision went wrong. He ended up depressed as a girl and transitioned to male.
- Male newborns who are born with not fully formed or functional male genitalia are frequently also re-assigned to female surgically. But they tend to transition back to male much more often than those who are born with just female genitalia:
	- In a study of 16 genetically male people, 2 were assigned and raised as male, while the other 14 were re-assigned and raised as female due to their condition. But 8 out of those 14 ended up identifying themselves as male during the course of the study, one had an unclear identity, and only 5 seemed to be happy living as female (without the knowledge that they were born male). ([Reiner and Gearhart, 2004](doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa022236))
	- A review of 3 conditions affecting male genitalia also "clearly indicate[s] an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood", although it also notes that the findings "are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens." ([Meyer-Bahlburg 2005](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9)).
		- This means that there might also be a genetic, epigenetic, and/or social factor in determining gender identity. 
		- Or it could mean that gender identity is real, but not that exact of a concept. For example that there is some space for variability in the way people interpret/translate similar feelings of gender dysphoria, gender euphoria, and so on into gender identity.

### "Gender identity can't be naturally misaligned with sex."
In all the examples given above, people are born with the correct body for their gender identity and are _then_ misaligned through surgeries or illness. But this doesn't prove yet that it is possible for a person to be _born_ with a body and gender identity that are misaligned from the start, as trans people claim of themselves. 

But if trans people weren't truly one gender trapped in the body of another and their distress was due to something other than that, then it follows that social and medical transition - which aligns their gender identity with their social environment and/or body - 
[couldn't be as effective as it is at minimizing gender dysphoria](!!!). If all trans people can only be lying cis people, they would all eventually detransition - but they, objectively, don't.

## "Where do we draw the line?" - Slippery slope argument

### Transage

"Transage" is a term invented by pedophiles (and other minor-attracted people) to morally justify their attraction to minors. They claim that while they may be of a certain chronological/legal or biological age, they "identify" as a child or teen, and can therefore date teenagers or children.

People drawing parallels to trans people are missing the fact that "transage" people do not call themselves "transage" because they actually feel like they ought to be a different age, but because they are trying to rationalize their **inherently harmful** attraction to minors. Trans people on the other hand transition out of an innate desire to be of a different sex and/or live as a different gender than previously, since it feels more natural to them. Not to **be with** someone else or to justify harm.

**Are there people who genuinely do feel like they are psychologically a different age than they are chronologically?** Yes, but it is not labelled "transage". For example 
- when someone says they feel like they are not where they should be for their age (their social status/"social age" doesn't correspond to their chronological age), 
- when when someone acts more "childish" than they should (their psychological age does not correspond to their chronological age), 
- or [prisoners, who tend to age faster and hence have an older "biological age" than chronological](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/08/24/do-you-age-faster-in-prison) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20220728170405/https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/08/24/do-you-age-faster-in-prison)).

**Comparing "transage" and being transgender doesn't hold up not only in practice, but also in theory:** Age refers to a person's **history** and is constantly updating and changing, while a person's gender as well as sex is a comparatively stable, **present** fact about them. Even genderfluid people change between recurring gender identities. To change one's age, one would have to change their birth date, i.e. an event in the past, which is and always will be physically impossible. It would be more comparable to a trans person (genuinely, not merely for safety reasons) claiming they are not trans and never have been. Changing the present or future is theoretically possible, [even if medicine might not yet be at a point where sex can be _entirely_ changed.](!!!)

What can be done is to prevent or at least slow the aging process and therefore, in some sense, "change" people's "biological age". But we already do this since the dawn of medicine by treating diseases, and it is anything but controversial. The average person who today is chronologically 50 is at a different stage in their aging process (=biological age) than someone from the middle ages who is also chronologically 50. In some sense we have all become "transage", if we choose to use the term this way.
