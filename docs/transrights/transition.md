## What is medical transition?

Medical transition is the act of voluntarily changing one's sex characteristics with hormones and/or sex-reassignment surgeries (SRS) with the aim to feel more at ease/congruent with one's body.

**Hormonal measures:**
- administration of HRT ([cross-sex] hormone replacement therapy) causes the start of either estrogenic (typically female) or androgenic (typically male) puberty. Permanent changes from previous puberty/puberties (if occured), such as facial and body hair growth or skeletal changes, cannot be undone with hormones alone. _[HRT is mostly, but not entirely reversible.]_
- Hormone blockers stop the effects of endogenous hormones (those that the body produces by itself), but only for as long as they continue to be taken. _[Blockers are reversible, but can cause allergic reactions or minor side effects in some cases, like all medication.]_

**Surgical measures:**
- top surgery (double mastectomy or breast augmentation) _[mostly irreversible]_
- bottom surgery (genital surgeries, removal of reproductive organs) _[mostly irreversible]_
	- Masculinizing: phalloplasty (different methods and sizes possible), metoidioplasty, urethral lengthening, scrotoplasty, vaginectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy (also called ovariectomy)
	- Feminizing: vaginoplasty (different methods and depths possible), labiaplasty, clitoroplasty, penectomy, orchiectomy
- other surgeries [mostly irreversible]
	- facial feminization (FFS) or masculinization surgery (FMS)	
	- clavicle surgery (shortening or lengthening)
	- permanent facial and/or body hair removal or facial hair transplant(s)
	- voice feminization or masculinization surgery, removal of Adam's apple (tracheal shave)

**More terms:**
- "Pre-HRT"/"pre-OP" means the person desires to but has not yet received a certain treatment
- "post-OP" means the person had a certain surgery
- "non-HRT"/"non-OP" means the person did not receive a certain treatment nor wishes to pursue it

Some studies and resources might use the acronym SRS to only refer to bottom surgery, however, this website will use SRS to refer to any of the listed surgeries.

## "Medical transition does not alleviate gender dysphoria or improve quality of life. Most people regret it and detransition."

For puberty blockers specifically see the section about [trans youth](https://antireaction.github.io/queerrights-en/docs/transrights/transyouth.html).

It should also be noted right away that improved quality of life and alleviation of gender dysphoria are not synonymous and are measued differently. From [Asscheman et al. (2011)](doi.org/10.1530/eje-10-1038):

> Psychological evaluation has shown that sex reassignment increases the well-being of transsexuals, but it should not be considered as a cure-all; it is rehabilitative relieving gender dysphoria, but some transsexual subjects may still experience other problems
(e.g. comorbid psychiatric problems, social isolation, troubled relationships, prejudice, and discrimination)

The former often results from the latter, but as there are many other factors that influence quality of life (e.g. discrimination, physical health, past unresolved trauma), this isn't guranteed, and trans advocates are not claiming it is.

### Studies & meta-analyses
The following studies looked at the psychological well-being of and/or alleviation of gender dysphoria in medically transitioning/transitioned individuals and their satisfaction/regrets. 

They then compared them either with their own past psychological state or control groups of other trans people who have no yet medically transitioned (but desire to).

- **Tested:** effects of HRT together with some type of SRS
- **Sample:** 28 studies with a total of 1093 trans women and 801 trans men participating (1833 total). 8 were longitudinal (followed the same trans people through transition)	and 20 cross-sectional (compared trans people at different stages of transition to each other)
- **Results:** SRS and HRT decrease gender dysphoria (80%), improve psychological functioning and comorbidities (78%), sexual function (72%), and overall quality of life
- **Flaws:** low quality data, as the treshhold for inclusion was low

**[De Vries et. al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-2958)**
- **Tested:** psychological effects of hormone blockers, HRT, and SRS (vaginoplasty for trans women or mastectomy with hysterectomy & oophorectomy for trans men) over 8 year period, starting from before the start of puberty blockers in the early stages of puberty until 1 year after SRS in young adulthood, using questionnaires
- **Sample:** 22 trans women and 33 trans men
- **Results:** 
	- alleviation of gender dysphoria
	- continual improvement of psychological functioning
	- psychological functioning on par with or better than that of cisgender peer by young adulthood
- **Flaws:** small sample size

- **Note:** Lawrence (2003) and Lawrence (2006) used the same sample of trans people and analyzed slightly different things about them, so there's actually only 49 distinct samples with significant improvement. 
- **Results:**
	- Of 55 studies, 50 showed a statistically significant improvement in well-being, 1 a statistically insignificant improvement (but which the review lists as a study that showed improvement), and 4 showed mixed results or no improvement. Those with mixed/neutral results were not higher quality than those with positive results.
	- _None consistently showed worse well-being than before transition._
	- Even those studies that had mixed results or not statistically significant improvements in quality of life reported most  being more satisified with their bodies afterwards (indicating that physical gender dysphoria was alleviated).
	-  **Medical transition clearly reduces suicide risk and gender dysphoria. Detransition rates are consistently 0-3% for all studies published in the 21st century, 5.4% in one study from 1997.**

<section markdown="1">

This is a pooling together of 
- (a) studies and reviews about well-being and regrets after HRT and/or SRS ranging from 1961 to 1991 (30 years), from various countries (mostly the US and Europe) and 
- (b) a clinical sample of people who Friedemann Pfäfflin treated himself (in Germany) since 1978 for variously long periods and with different regularity.

**Sample:** 
- (a) 74 follow-up studies and 9 reviews with approximately 1000 to 1600 trans women and 400 to 550 trans men participating (exact estimates impossible due to sometimes overlapping samples)
- (b) 196 trans women and 99 trans men

**Results:** 
- (a) Across all studies and reviews, 4 FtM transitioners and 14 MtF transitioners genuinely regretted medical transition (including SRS) [regret rate of <1% and 1-1,5% respectively]
	- Of the 4 regretful FtM transitioners,... 
		- 1 only regretted evading regulations and getting the phalloplasty done outside the gender clinic, which brought complications. But he did not regret having transitioned overall and lived alternating between male and female. 
		- 2 were confirmed to have detransitioned socially and 1 case expressed regret about one surgery, but it's not known whether they detransitioned socially.
	- Additionally, 1 trans woman commited suicide during HRT (before SRS), 1 underwent religious conversion (on HRT but before SRS), 1 considered living as male again (but it is not reported whether they did), and 2 occasionally went back to living as male, 1 of whom only did so to not loose claim to inheretance.
	- Regret was associated with bad surgical outcomes, not undergoing any real life test, and/or no proper differential diagnosis.
- (b) No reported regrets among trans men and 3 reported regrets among MtF transitioners [1,53%] 2-6 years after bottom surgery.
- The author concludes that overall, trans people who wished to undergo SRS did not regret doing so when they did. 

**Flaws:** Only clinical samples, old data

- **Sample:** 29 studies

- **Flaws:** 
	- Studies need more "clearly defined transgender populations, divided by stage of gender affirming treatment and with appropriate matched control groups" to draw "firmer conclusions".

### "But the quality of evidence is low!"

Some might respond to the above citations with the argument that papers often describe the quality of evidence to be mostly low, which supposedly means that recommendations for transition as treatment for gender dysphoria cannot be made **This is untrue.**

First of all, a lot of low quality evidence adds up and in sum becomes more reliable. For example, one of the criteria for evidence to be considered high quality is having a large sample size - but adding up many studies with smaller (but different) samples has the same effect taken together.

Second of all, a treatment can still receive a strong recommendation despite the quality of evidence being low for it's effectiveness. For example, when the alternatives (another treatment or doing nothing) poses an even bigger, less acceptable, or more certain risk than possible risks of the examined treatment. [Here's a simple and short presentation](https://childrensoncologygroup.org/downloads/GRADE_COG_strong_recs_low_quality_evid_26Jul2018.pdf) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210902195358/https://childrensoncologygroup.org/downloads/GRADE_COG_strong_recs_low_quality_evid_26Jul2018.pdf)) with a different example of this using the GRADE approach (one of many [hierarchies of evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_evidence)).

From [Byne et al. (2012)](doi.org/10.1007/s10508-012-9975-x) (a report of the APA's task force on the issue):

> The quality of evidence pertaining to most aspects of treatment in all subgroups was determined to be low; however, areas of broad clinical consensus were identified and **were deemed sufficient to support recommendations for treatment in all subgroups.** With subjective improvement as the primary outcome measure, **current evidence was judged sufficient to support recommendations for adults** in the form of an evidence-based APA Practice Guideline with gaps in the empirical data supplemented by clinical consensus.

There is a big enoug _amount_ of low quality of evidence (clinical practices, low-quality studies, etc.) that it adds up to be enough for giving recommendations.

**Why don't we have more high quality evidence?**

Because the criteria for evidence to be considered high quality usually includes long-term follow-ups and big, randomized samples with control groups. This is always difficult to achieve with small, hidden populations, who trans people happen to be. Especially with the little funding studies on trans people receive. There are also ethical concerns with trans control groups, i.e. not allowing equally qualified trans patients to transition for a long period of time to compare them to trans patients that did transition.

The reason is not, as some cissexists try to imply, because high quality evidence would supposedly disprove the narratives of trans advocates and is therefore suppressed. Note how the quality of evidence is equally low for those studies that have favourable and those that have less favourable outcomes from transitioning.

### Honeymoon theory and loss at follow-up

Honeymoon in this context describes a period after SRS and/or HRT during which people are misrepresentatively happy with their results. 

According to the argument, many follow-up studies therefore weren't conducted for long enough to detect the long-term, negative outcomes of medical transition, i.e. until after this honeymoon wore off.

Those studies that do have a long-enough follow-up period all have too many losses. Loss at follow-up should be counted as equivalent to a bad outcome, i.e. regret or a worsening of gender dysphoria, because that is supposedly the most likely reason for patients to drop out.

The studies that have a long-enough follow-up period without many losses have the worst conclusions regarding the effectiveness of medical transition.

There are several counter-points to be made:
1. Whether or not there is a honeymoon after medical transition as there is with other procedures, and if so, how long it lasts, is not well-established.
2. Loss at follow-up is unlikely to automatically translate to regret or a bad outcome of medical transition like it does with other procedures.
3. There are studies that have both a long enough follow-up period and have a low (genuine) loss at follow-up, still showing that medical transition alleviates physical gender dysphoria.
4. The few studies with mixed results that there are are not generally of higher quality than those with positive results. (for elaboration see "Counter-studies that aren't actually counters" further down and the PDF breaking down Cornell University's literature review from earlier)

#### The honeymoon theroy

The concept is somewhat recognized in literature, such as in [De Cuypere et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2006.04.002) (a honeymoon period of 1 year mentioned). 

However, [Kraemer et al. (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18033979) for example shows no correlation between the length of follow-up after SRS and well-being. [Cardoso da Silva et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.03.370) (for trans women) and [Rotondi et al. (2011)](doi.org/10.7870/cjcmh-2011-0021) (for trans men) both even showed the reverse: That having had surgery or a revision more recently was associated with worse mental health outcomes compared to having had it done longer ago, which makes sense since patients still need to physically recover and go to check-ups more the more recent the procedure was. There are also [anecdotal reports](https://genderqueer.me/2011/02/26/post-surgical-depression/) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210819222517/https://genderqueer.me/2011/02/26/post-surgical-depression/)) of post-surgery depression which is completely unrelated to actual regret or detransition.

But for the sake of argument, let's generously assume that a honeymoon after any physical gender dysphoria treatment (start of HRT and any surgery) is a verified occurrance with a duration of at least one year to about 8 years, as this seems to be the average time after which people decide to detransition for any reason ([Landen et al. (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1998.tb10001.x): 7.4 years; [Dhejne et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-014-0300-8): 7.5 years for trans men, 8.5 years for trans women).

#### Loss at follow-up/drop-outs

Patients who drop out of a follow-up study are more likely to be those with worse outcomes, in support of which [Murray et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620X.79B2.0790254) is usually cited. 

The study examined patients of joint replacement surgical procedures and showed that patients lost at follow-up are more likely to have had worse outcomes at their last attended follow-up than those who were not lost, speculating that the reason they dropped out or died might be percicesly because of their physical condition getting even worse. So they either die or see no point in continuing the treatment and reporting back. The same can be applied, or so the cissexists argue, to medical transition.

But dropping out does not translate to worse outcomes in medical transition as it does with joint replacement, because medical transition is fundamentally different from other medical procedures regarding it's very function and the nature of it's patient population.

- **Ⅰ. Functional difference: Medical transition fascilitates a social transition into a new beginning/life/role**.

After it, many former patients might not want any reminders of their pre-transition past. They might decline to participate in a follow-up because of this or even purposefully try to erase any traces into their new lives, making it harder to even locate them. 

This is recognzed by researchers too. For example, here's an excerpt from [Eldh et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.3109/02844319709010503):

> Knowing that many patients do not want any contact after the operation together with  that fact that there are great difficulties in locating or keeping in touch with transsexual patients, a postoperatively 66% response to the questionnaire is a better result than we could have expected. 

In [De Cuypere et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2006.04.002) some people outright stated that they're not participating specifically because they do not wish to be reminded of the fact that they are trans.

In [Lawrence (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1024086814364) people specified privacy concerns and mistrust towards the investigator's motives for not participating.

But even for those who have not sent a response specifying their reasons for not participating, one can assume that there are at least some amongst them who had the same reasons, but were too lazy to send back mail.

- **Ⅱ. Population difference: Death among trans people, including suicide, is much more likely to be due to discrimination than among other patient populations.** 

Discrimination can easily lead to poverty and social isolation, and these in turn lead to bad physical and/or psychological health. [Suicide rates among trans people are known to drop dramatically with even the slightest social support](https://antireaction.github.io/queerrights-en/docs/transrights/genderidentity.html#trans-people-are-inherently-mentally-ill).

[Johansson et al. (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-009-9551-1) found that participants who were lost to follow-up tended to have worse scores (than those who were not lost) even at initial contact with the clinic. This could idicate that whatever made their outcome worse was present regardless of medical transition and it's outcome itself, e.g. more severe discrimination or poverty, such as in the form of less support from family and friends.

There are also some studies, such as [Weigert et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.prs.0000434415.70711.49), which show the opposite: Those lost to follow-up had higher satisfaction at the last follow-up they partook in, than those who continued to be followed up until the end of the study. 

The fact that this study only included trans women who already underwent bottom surgery and HRT and were now pursuing breast augmentation potentially explains this unusual result. Additionally it can be interpreted as being further evidence for point Ⅰ.: Those patients whose recovery from breast augmentation, presumably the last surgery they were planning to undergo, was faster, were able to move on into their new lives and break off old contacts sooner, since they needed less revisions/corrections or check-ups. Hence, they participated less in the later follow-ups, indicating satisfaction with the results, rather than the opposite.

---

Because of all this I find it more helpful to calculate the "genuine loss at follow-up", counting only people who either 
1. were confirmed to have detransitioned,
2. who are believed to have been located correctly, but did not respond for unknown reasons (generously assuming that no mail was lost, no patient was wrongly located, and that none were satisified with transition but just too lazy to respond), or 
3. died from suicide (generously assuming that the suicide was due to transition regret rather than discrimination/bullying or poverty).

People who have 
- specified other reasons (unrelated to psychological health) for not participating, 
- who just could not be located and contacted (which is likely because they made an active effort to leave no traces behind and start a new life),
- or died from unrelated issues or surgery complications (which does not tell us anything about the psychological benefit or harm of medical transition),

...are not counted as _genuine_ losses at follow-up.

---

*#### 3. There are several long-term follow-up studies with relatively low adjusted drop-out rates

Follow-up longer than 1 year of HRT and/or after some type of SRS:

So, here are a couple studies that have a follow-up period of 8 years or more:

Ironically, cissexists do not hold their own studies, which supposedly show bad outcomes, to the same strict standards. There is _not a single study_ with low drop out rates and a follow-up of 8 years or more that supports their view that medical transition does not alleviate physical gender dysphoria. 

The only couple of studies that they do cite usually have to be misrepresented by them to look like they support their point:

### Counter-studies that aren't actually counters

Some cissexists try to cite the following studies, but which don't at all say what they think they do:

<details>

<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **[Dhejne et al. (2011)](doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016885)** ("The Sweden study") 
</summary> 

<section markdown="1">

- **Tested:** mortality and psychiatric morbidity after medical transition **compared to the general population**
- **Sample:** 191 trans women and 133 trans men who medically transitioned (with SRS)
- **Result:**
> "[Trans people after medical transition] have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity **than the general population**. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although **alleviating gender dysphoria**, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group."

_The study does not conclude that SRS makes gender dysphoria worse_, but that it is usually not _enough_ treatment for all the suffering (e.g. discrimination, being disowned by family, undergoing alienating puberty, possible lasting trauma from all of these things) trans people might go through.

In fact, one of the authors of the study [constantly has to correct journalists](https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210731210336/https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm)) misrepresenting her study:

> **Dhjene**: People who misuse the study always omit the fact that the study clearly states that it is not an evaluation of gender dysphoria treatment. If we [look](doi.org/10.1111/jsm.12363) at the [literature](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-009-9551-1), we [find](10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03625.x) that [several](https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/960745) recent [studies](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-014-0453-5) conclude that WPATH Standards of Care compliant treatment [decrease gender dysphoria](doi.org/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01082.x) and improves mental health.

Cissexists citing this study for their claims are advised to visit an English reading comprehension course or to make an appointment at the oculist.

</summary> 

<section markdown="1">

- **Tested:** associations between medical transition and quality of life
- **Sample:** clinical sample of 77 trans women, 41 trans men, and 25 non-binary people (1 of whom was assigned intersex at birth) in Switzerland
- **Results:** Cissexists usually only focus on the following sentence from the study, despite the authors contradicting it numerous times at other points:
> "But neither the hormonal nor the surgical obtained any predictive significance regarding [quality of life]."
- But the study notes _multiple times_ that they only included trans people who considered their medical transition to already be complete. The study _did not actually examine the effects of receiving or not receiving medical interventions **that one desires.**
> "In this sense, we can assume that no trans person who participated hoped to improve their [quality of life] by initiating further medical measures. In addition, the cross-sectional design of this study does not allow further comparison of the QoL before the medical transition of the participants. Accordingly, **no statements can be made as to whether the [gender affirming interventions] changed the [quality of life] of the trans persons or not.**"
- Obviously, giving a surgery to a trans person who does not desire that surgery will not make that particular trans person happier - trans people have different desires for their medical transition, if they desire one at all.
- To back up this claim, here's [van de Grift et al. (2017a)](doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000465) as an example, which states:
> "Within  the  “hormones  only”  group  different  scores were observed between the people who planned (n = 14) and did not plan (n = 21) to undergo genital surgery in the future with regard to overall body satisfaction (M[planned] = 3.29 (SD: .61), M[not planned] = 2.35 (SD: .54); t(33) = 4.75, p < .001) as well as for genital body satisfaction (M[planned] = 4.76 (SD: .40), M[not planned] = 2.42 (SD: 1.03); t(33) = 8.07, p < .001). (Note: higher scores mean higher dissatisfaction on these scales.)"
- I.e. those that still had more unsatisfied wishes regarding their medical transition were also still more dissatisfied than those who did not have as many remaining needs/were closer to considering themselves fully transitioned.

- **Tested:** Correlations between mood and anxiety disorder healthcare visits and antidepressant and anxiolytic prescriptions and time since medical transition
- **Sample:** Everyone (2,679 people) in the Swedish population who had received a gender incongruence diagnosis (called "transsexualism" or "gender identity disorder" at the time) between 2005 and 2015
- **Results:** 
> Years since initiating hormone treatment was not significantly related to likelihood of mental health treatment [...]. However, increased time since last gender-affirming surgery was associated with reduced mental health treatment [...].
- A [correction to the study](https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.1778correction) says the following, which cissexists like to misrepresent:
> Upon request, the authors reanalyzed the data to compare outcomes between individuals diagnosed with gender incongruence who had received gender-affirming **surgical** treatments and those diagnosed with gender incongruence who had not. While this comparison was performed retrospectively and was not part of the original research question **given that several other factors may differ between the groups**, the results demonstrated no advantage of surgery in relation to subsequent mood or anxiety disorder-related health care visits or prescriptions or hospitalizations following suicide attempts in that comparison.
- This analysis does not show that medical does not alleviate physical gender dysphoria in those who desire it, as
1. the study did not look at gender dysphoria - but instead anxiety, mood-disorders, and suicide attempts -,
2. there were several other factors that differed between those who did receive SRS and those who didn't, and 
3. the analysis showed no difference between those who received _surgical_ treatments and those who didn't (which might very well be due to differences in the individuals' physical gender dysphoria to begin with, see the points raised regarding Jellestadt et al. (2018) above) - not hormonal measures or social transition.

Several of the following studies examine psychopathology or objective measures of quality of life. But they, as already said, examine psychopathology and quality of life, _not alleviation of gender dysphoria_. From [Lawrence 2003](doi.org/10.1023/a:1024086814364):

> Kuiper and Cohen-Kettenis (1988) expressed this viewpoint succinctly: “In our opinion an evaluation of SRS can be made only on the basis of subjective data, because SRS is intended to solve a problem that cannot be determined objectively” (p. 441).

	- Trans women had a 51% higher mortality total, but this was due to non-hormone-related causes such as suicide, AIDS, cardiovascular disease (partially due to ethinyl estradiol use - prescriptions for feminizing HRT have since changed -, partially due to higher smoking rates), drug abuse, and unknown causes.

This study did not examine alleviation of gender dysphoria and hence also did not prove that medical transition doesn't alleviate it.

In fact, it clearly shows that trans men's mortality is that of the general population when they medically transition. Trans women's elevated mortality - including suicide rates - can easily be explained by discrimination and resulting poverty (hence the drug abuse and AIDS) rather than regretting transition. Additionally, the sample of trans women was older than the sample of trans men:

> [I]t should be taken into consideration that FtM started cross-sex hormones (testosterone) at a younger age than MtF (at mean age 26.1 years compared with MtF at age 31.1 years) [...]. The effects of aging may thus carry less weight in the FtM group [...] than the MtF group. 

Furthermore, the study did not measure mortality before medical transition. One cannot discern whether medical transition might have still overall decreased mortality for trans women, just not enough to bring it down to that of the general population.

- **Results:** 
	- employment decreased heavily for trans women and a bit for trans men
	- social and sex life of most trans women did not improve, but half of the trans men had stable social lives
	- 2 trans women detransitioned, everyone else was content or wanted to continue transitioning, although 1 trans man was afraid of human contact and had several suicide attempts since the surgeries.
	- The authors concluded that a major predictor for post-SRS life improvement was pre-SRS employment, social integration, and emotional stability. The trans men in their sample tended to already be better socially integrated before transition.

1. The study is small (especially the sample of trans men) and is not of higher quality than the much bigger amount of studies with positive outcomes. It is therefore an outlier and the authors themselves note the atypicality of their sample.

2. This study does not show that medical transition does not generally alleviate gender dysphoria. All except 2 trans people still stated to be happy with having transitioned [11,8% detransition rate]. Transition **alleviated their gender dysphoria**, but the discrimination and possible surgical complications that followed overrode the positive effects of this alleviation on their quality of life - both things that are avoidable if society was less discriminating.

- Cissexists, however, are only interested in the following paragraph:
> "[I]n our study, we found no difference between those who had already undergone sex reassignment and those who had not in terms of any subscale of psychopathology. Therefore sex reassignment surgery doesn’t seem to be a major contributor to psychosocial well-being in our transsexual sample."

1. The study is small and does not have better quality of evidence than the much bigger amount of studies showing different outcomes. It is therefore an outlier.
2. The study did not examine alleviation of gender dysphoria, but psychopathology. Since none of the patients reported regret, nor have detransitioned due to a change in identity, it is reasonable to assume gender dysphoria itself was succesfully alleviated in all of them. Trans adovocates do not claim that alleviation of gender dysphoria automatically solves all mental health issues a person has.
3. The study did not record whether the patients that only received HRT considered their transition to already be complete. Given the fact that this was a long-term follow-up study, it is reasonable to assume that those people who at follow-up had still not undergone SRS (after 13 to 2 years of HRT, which is theoretically more than enough to get SRS covered by insurance in Germany) were not planning to ever do so to begin with. See under ‣ Jellestad et al. (2018) for further explanation of this fallacy.

- **Result:** From the abstract:
> Surgical outcome was disappointing, and only one-third of the patients where a vaginal construction was carried out had a functioning vagina. [...] [O]nly one-third were judged as having a fair or good sexual adjustment after sex reassignment. [...] Psychosocial adjustment showed a slight improvement after surgery.

Despite their returning to a male social role after surgery, however, two of the repenting patients were judged as fairly well adjusted from a psychosocial point of view. 

1. Most issues were connected to bad surgigcal outcomes, which have improved greatly since. Specifically from 1985 and after, major improvements to the surgical techniques were achieved. All participants in this study have been operated in 1980 or earlier. From [Eldh et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.3109/02844319709010503), also a Swedish study from the same hospital:

> The total overall number of operations/patient was 8.1 [...] before 1986 and 3.1 [...] from 1986-1995. The median total stay in hospital was 80.0 days [...] and 25.4 days [...], divided into 6.9 admissions/patient [...] and 3.1 admissions [...] respectively [...].
2. Does not actually show that gender dysphoria was not alleviated in most patients: It had 2 detransitioners and 2 people who had regrets but didn't want to detransition. Everyone else, including those whose life situation worsened, were confident that transition was the right choice for them. This is, however, still an unusually high and unfortunate detransition rate of 15.4%.
3. Several drop-outs, who at such a small sample size are all the more significant. Most importantly, 1 patient simply moved abroad and 3 other patients were automatically considered failures because _they weren't offered "full" (including vaginoplasty) bottom surgery in the first place._ 1 other person committed suicide at the point of follow-up.

### How do we avoid regret & detransition?

[Work in Progress]

> **Note:** The following section was partly inspired by and took many arguments from [Shonalika's video "JK Rowling and the detransition narrative"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFURGp99ofE), even though I disagree with some statements in it).

First of all we should differentiate between types of regrets and types of detransition:

A person may regret transition for various reasons, including 
	- social (e.g. loosing friends, family, their job, having to spend a lot of money), 
	- physical (e.g. their health became worse due to complications or an interaction with diseases or disabilities they had beforehand) 
	- or psychological (e.g. they feel worse after it/gain gender dysphoria). 

A person can also detransition 
	- to various degrees (e.g. only socially, but continuing to transition medically; or the other way around),
	- for various lengths (e.g. they only offset their medical transition until they solved another health issue they have) 
	- and reasons (e.g. their family pressured them into social detransition, but they retransition as soon as they are independent from them; or their gender dysphoria worsened and they realized they aren't trans). 

Not all regretful transitioners detransition, not all detransitioners actually regret transition, not all detransitions affect the same aspects (social, medical, legal), and not all detransitions are forever.

To avoid (often temporary) detransition due to discrimination (which is maybe better described with "going back into the closet"), we need to 1. build ways for people in transphobic environments to escape those environments easier and become more econmically independent (e.g. free housing so people can move out of abusive households easier and faster) and 2. make society itself less transphobic by educating people.

To avoid detransition for health reasons, we need to study treatments for trans people and their interactions with various other things that have until now been often ignored (e.g. intersex traits, older age).

---

The detransitioners who are paid most attention to are who I'll refer to as cis medical detransitioners, i. e. those who medically (and not just socially) transitioned with the conviction that they are trans and then detransitioned due to realizing they are not (rather than due to social pressure or health reasons), i. e. are technically cis, albeit with a more complicated history than most other cis people. They are often exploited by anti-trans reactionaries to argue for the banning or strong restriction of access to trans healthcare for everyone. However, as shown by the low rates of detransition (even if including social pressured ones) and the well-established fact that medical transition alleviates gender dysphoria and potentially saves lives of those who _are_ trans (see above), this would do more harm than good overall. It would eventually kill or ruin the lives of _way_ more trans people than it would save mistaken cis people.

So how do we instead help avoid cis medical detransitioners/people being mistaken about benefitting from medical transition and undergoing irreversible procedures before realizing their mistake, resulting in a comparatively tragic outcome? It seems that the right approach is the percise opposite of what many anti-trans reactionaries advocate for:

<details>

	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **1. More openness discussing medical transition and trans identities.** 

</summary>

Some medical detrans cis people say that they were not told that medical transition is in large parts irreversible. If society is more open about discussing the procedures of medical transition, the information about it - including how far it is reversible or irreversible - becomes widely available and common knowledge. And when it becomes common knowledge, mistakes due to mere ignorance will happen much less.

</details>

<details>

	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **2. Less pressure on trans and questioning people and the end of transmedicalism.** 

</summary> 

<section markdown="1">
There is a certain pressure on those who think they are trans to transition as fast as they can, or they are declared not "real trans people". This is done by some trans people as well as many cis people, who will refuse to help a person try out pronouns, names or titles, unless they first prove that they are truly trans. Transmedicalism defines trans identity by the strong desire for medical transition, and hence proving one is truly trans is only done by trying to medically transition as fast as possible, creating a cycle: If you want to experiment and see if you're truly trans and whether you would benefit from medical transition, prove to us first that you are truly trans by being absolutely sure about medical transition.

Another issue is how people are expected to decide once and for all whether they are trans, on one hand leading to non-out questioning people to be hesitant about coming out (since they might feel like they have to be 100% sure and cannot take it back anymore) and on the other questioning out people being afraid to pause, slow down or stop medical or social transition to think, in fear of ridicule or people taking away the option to resume transition if they want to again if they ever dared to admit doubts about their identity.

More openness for experimentation, vagueness, and questioning will give people the room they need to breathe, think, try and re-try, etc.

	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **3. Fight against sexism and homophobia instead of increasing transphobia.** 

</summary> 

<section markdown="1">

A common narrative surrounding detransition is that people first decide to transition to escape sexism or homophobia, e.g. the woman who was tired of her body being sexualized or the lost lesbian sister or the effamite boy who thought it'd be easier to wear skirts if he had breasts while doing so. 

These narratives also commonly spread harmful lies such as that it is supposedly easy to access medical transition - but for the vast majority of people in the world, including Europe, this isn't so. A minority of countries provide informed consent options, most others either have no options for medical transition or have very strict gatekeeping, to the point that some people turn to illegal measures such as DIY HRT (buying HRT illegally/semi-legally, often from overseas, and administering it themselves). And even in those that do provide informed consent options, especially teens are unlikely to have enough money for it, which are - according to anti-trans narratives - the most vulnerable to the "transgender trend" and rushing into medical transition. Another myth these narratives spread is that there is supposedly _generally_ more sexism and/or homophobia than transphobia, which is demonstrably not the case (see economic statistics, suicide statistics, murder & harassment rates, surveys on opinions, etc. - trans people score much worse than both cis heterosexual women and cis non-heterosexual people of either binary gender).

However, I do think there could be a kernel of truth in the assertion that some _individual_ people experience more sexism and/or homophobia than transphobia or are under the impression pre-transition that there is less sexism and/or homophobia than transphobia. I don't know of any representative statistics about how many genuine detransitioners initially thought they are/wanted to be/identified as trans for which reasons, but anecdotal reports on the internet do show that it is not a unique/one-time case/experience for people to initially identify as trans due to (internalized or not) sexism or homophobia. 

But the solution to this is not restricting access to medical transition and increasing transphobia, but fighting against sexism and homophobia - something which I rarely see anti-trans reactionaries do. Almost as if they never truly cared for the lives of detransitioners or the cause of avoiding mistakes like these, and instead merely want to exploit their stories to further their anti-trans agenda. Detransitioners deserve much better help and attention than that.

## "Medical transition is physically harmful."

### "Sex reassignment surgeries are experimental/too dangerous/understudied"

[Work in progress]

### "Sex reassignment surgeries are mutilation"

According to [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/body-modifications-and-mutilations) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210513121958/https://www.britannica.com/science/body-modifications-and-mutilations)), the term "body mutilation" is typically used to refer to involuntary body modifications. [Wikipedia adds, at least for genital mutilation specifically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification#Controversy) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210416220759/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification)):

> The phrase "Genital mutilation" is sometimes used to describe procedures that individuals are forced to undergo without their informed consent, or **without anesthesia or sterilised surgical tools.**

But _consensual_ modifications - ranging from tattoos to heart surgeries - are considered just modifications, not mutilations. Wikipedia differentiates further as follows:

> In many ways self-mutilation is very different than body-modification. Body modification gives one the feeling of pride and excitement, giving one something to show off to others. Alternately, those who self-mutilate typically are ashamed of what they've done and want to hide any evidence of harm. Body modification is explored for adornment, self-expression, and an array of many other positive reasons, while self-mutilation is inflicted because of mental or emotional stress and the inability to cope with psychological pain. Those who self-mutilate do so in order to punish themselves, express internal turmoil, and reduce severe anxiety.

In sum we find the following defining differences:

| Body modification | Body mutilaton | 
| :------------: | :----------:
| always with informed consent, voluntary | no informed consent, involuntary| 
| usually uses sterilized tools and anesthesia as needed | possibly does not use sterilized tools or anesthesia even when there is a need for it | 
| done for positive reasons such as self-expression; results are shown off | often a form of punishment or a last resort when one is unable to deal with psychological pain |

Medical transition (=/= any sex reassignment) clearly falls under the term of body modification, rather than mutilation:
	1. It is only performed with informed consent. (probably the strongest and most important point to be made here)
	2. It is performed in safe, sterile environments with anesthesia and proper tools by professionals.
	3. It is performed not as punishmet, but as self-expression. People feel excitement from it.
		- While one of the major motivators for medical transition is psychological pain in the form of gender dysphoria, medical transition is different from self-harm here in that it actually alleviates and solves the issue. People self-mutilate because they are unable to productively cope with their distress, but trans people transitioning _is_ a productive coping mechanism, as it has been shown to [alleviate gender dysphoria long-term in almost all cases](!!!). Self-harm on the other hand does not rid a person of anxiety or internal turmoil permanently, only in the moment.


While whether or not the procedure leaves a person more disabled or not is not mentioned as a defining trait in the used sources, anti-trans narratives often include the argument that medical transition is mutilation due to it's supposedly physically destructive character, so I will address that as well. 
	Medical transition does not simply rid a person's body of certain functions/impair them, but can also add new ones (e.g. metoidioplasty giving people the ability to have natural, visible erections) or only removes abilities that the person sees as limiting/impairing in the first place (e.g. removal of reproductive organs of the assigned sex), and hence actually makes them _more_ abled subjectively by removing something that, in a mental sense, disables them. SRS is not destructive, but reconstructive.

Calling it mutilation despite all of this - but not other helpful, consensual medical procedures - is discriminatory towards trans people (why condemn medical transition but not other helpful body modifications?) and is unjustly stigmatizing a life-saving practice. Furthermore it is disrespectful towards those who _do_ self-harm or are mutilated by others.

---

Who mutilation in the form of sex re-assignment does happen to, however, are certain [intersex minors](!!!), even when the procedure is not medically necessary (i. e. saves lives or certain important bodily functions) and has purely aesthetic goals. Ironically, the types of people who decry medical transition as mutilation tend to not care about the forced re-assignment of intersex infants or even promote this harmful practice. 

An example of this is the [Arksansas House Bill 1570](https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FHB1570.pdf) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210513182601/https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FHB1570.pdf)), also ironically called "Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act" (SAFE Act), which bans all gender-affirming medical care to trans youth as being dangerous and experimental (which it isn't), but _explicitly_ allows practitioners to re-assign intersex minors (even when their life is not endangered by being intersex). From pages 6 and 7 of the bill:

> "[...] (B)  “Gender transition procedures” do not include:
> 
> 	(i)  Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development [=intersex traits] [...]

> 	(ii)  Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development that the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing that the person does not have normal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action; [...]

> 	(iv)  Any procedure undertaken because the individual suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of major bodily function unless surgery is performed;

Point (iv) makes clear that point (i) and (ii) serve to allow intersex re-assignment _even when leaving things as they are doesn't place them in imminent danger_, because those cases where they do pose a danger are already included in point (iv). Therefore point (i) and (ii) would be redundant if they _only_ referred to intersex children whose health is in danger without intervention.

Policies like these show that many of the people insisting on using the term "mutilation" or "experimental" for medical transition are not genuinely concerned about bodily autonomy or safety of minors, because if they were, they would care and talk much more about the proven harm of forced, unconsensual intersex re-assignments that routinely happen in the majority of countries today.
