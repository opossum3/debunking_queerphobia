## LGB without the T

A small group of LGB people oppose being grouped with trans people into one movement. 

A part of them thinks so because they think that being trans is inherently homophobic. They think trans people

- a) make formerly cis gay/lesbian people straight as the other binary gender by "transing" them (e.g. cis butch lesbians come out as straight trans men) or 
- b) force cis gay/lesbian people to be straight through forced dating (e.g. a trans man forces a cis gay man into dating him, but because they view the trans man as a woman in disguise, he is supposedly performing conversion on the cis gay man).

The latter comes from the belief that trans people are 
1. forcing anyone to date them in high frequencies ([which is outright false](!!!)) and 
2. that trans people are not really their gender identity/that this gender identity is irrelevant to attraction, as only chromosomes and reproductive organs (which cannot currently be changed) matter. But this is also untrue, as visible sex characteristics are more influential for most people's attractions - a cis man dating a trans woman who he perceives and considers to be an adequate woman is not gay, and therefore a cis man dating a trans man who he perceives and considers to be an dequate man is not straight. Therefore a trans and cis man dating is not automatically conversion of anyone's homosexuality.

Another part of "LGB without the T" advocates simply think that gay/lesbian/bi people face too different issues to be grouped with trans people, however:
1. Most trans people are gay/lesbian or bi, so even if you included only LGB people, a majority of trans people would still be included for their orientation. Starting an entire movement that would only achieve the [exclusion of about a fourth of trans people](!!!) is odd.
2. Arguments against gay/lesbian and trans people are literally the same, just rephrased a bit - all of them. And therfore LGB and T people should work together in fighting them, because their reactionary nature and basic thought process is the exact same. Take a look at this table:

| Argument/Occurance     | Against homosexuality| Against transness    |
|:-------------|:---------------|:------------------------|
|appeal to nature   | "Homosexuality is unnatural" | "Being trans is unnatural" |
|illness            | "Being gay is a mental illness." | "Being trans is a mental illness."|
|traumatic origin   | "Being gay is caused by childhood sexual trauma/issues with society's expectations, nonconformity/a too distanced father or mother/autism/shizophrenia/etc." | "Being trans is caused by sexual trauma/issues with society's expectations, nonconformity/a too distanced father or mother/autism/shizophrenia/etc." |
|the agenda         | "The gay agenda is to make all our kids gay!"| "The trans agenda is to make all our kids trans!" - e.g. ROGD |
|the agenda but it's even more evil | "Gay recruiters target especially vulnerable, traumatized/unstable/autistic/supposedly unable to think for themselves people to lure in." | "The transgender cult especially preys on autistic cis girls/gay cis boys/butch lesbians/etc. to convince them they're trans." |
|physical harm     | "Homosexuality is harmful - look at AIDs, the gay bowel syndrome, anal sex causing incontinence, etc." | "Being trans is harmful - those hormones cause cancers and heart disease, the surgeries are mutilations, experimental, and leave phantom sensations, etc."|
|curability | "Lesbians are only lesbian because they never had a good dick.", "Gay men just need to find a nice girl to settle down with." | "Trans people just need to be reminded of their biology by reproducing." or "Trans people just have to be forced to live as their assigned gender and will eventually get used to it and become cis."|
|movement of the "cured" | The ex-gay movement: Often got overproportional and misrepresentative attention, making it seem like a much more viable and universal "solution" (of something that doesn't need to be "solved"), or solution at all, than it actually is. | Transphobic detransitioners: Those detransitioners who specifically blame their (or their doctors') mistakes on all trans people and get over-proportional attention, making it seem like detransition is much more common than it really is. 
|lifstyle choice| "Being gay is a lifestyle choice." | "Being trans is a lifestyle choice." |
|failure | "Gay men/lesbian women are just failed/ugly, too effamite/too masculine men/women who couldn't get a girl/guy." | "Trans people are too ugly as their assigned gender so they turn to transition." or "Trans people just can't come to terms with being gender non-conforming as their assigned gender." or "Trans people are just gays/lesbians who suffer from internalized homophobia."|
|attention-seeking and trendiness| "Gay/lesbian/bi people just want attention, they don't have a real personality, so they're hopping onto a trend to feel special."|"Trans people just want attention, they don't have a real personality, so they're hopping onto a trend to feel special." |
|don't shove it in my face | "I'm fine with gay people, as long as they don't shove it in my face." (read: as long as they don't publicly exist at all) |"I'm fine with trans people as long as they don't shove it in my face" - and then in the same breath they will rant about trans people having to disclose their identity to everyone at all times (see the next point). |
|tell everyone | "Gay/lesbian people are immoral if they don't let everyone know they're gay/lesbian to avoid an employer hiring them even though they disagree with 'their lifestyle'/letting down a straight person who might fall in love with them." (admittedly has always been a rather rare rhetoric, but still, it did and does exist if you dig deep enough in homophobic circles)| "Trans people are immoral if they don't tell everyone they are trans, even before getting to know them, otherwise they are luring in and lying to people who might fall in love with them."|
|don't hit on me | "Yeah I'm fine that you're gay, just don't hit on me." (when nobody was even suggesting sleeping with the speaker) | "Yeah I'm fine that you're trans, but I won't sleep with you." (when nobody was even suggesting sleeping with the speaker) |
|slippery slope | "If we accept homosexuality, what will come next? Accepting zoophilia, pedophilia, going around naked outside? Society will degregate!" | "If we accept transgender people, what will come next? Accepting transspecies (=zoophilia), transethnicity, transage (=pedophilia)? I identify as a penguin!"|
|appeal to religion | "God said homosexuality is a sin" | "Rejecting god's creation is a sin" |
|god makes no mistakes | "God made so that male and female are complementary in their anatomy, he made us to be heterosexual physically and everyone has to follow that. He doesn't make mistakes."|"God can't accidentally put a female/male/ambiguous soul in a male/female(/ambiguous, although the demographic of people making this argument is, I assume, unlikely to acknowledge intersex people) body, he doesn't make mistakes."|

The lack of creativity of bigots is impressive.

## TERFs

### What is a "TERF" and is it a slur?

---
### "Terms like "menstruator" are dehumanizing because I am more than my reproductive organs. I should be allowed to call myself a woman."

*basically all trans people nod in agreement*

Terms like "menstruator" are made exactly to **not** be used as a synonym for "woman". They are meant to simply be more percise when talking about biological functions, by saying "menstruator" or "people who menstruate" you are shwoing that
1. it's not just women who menstruate (e.g. teenage girls and _some_ trans people do too, even though many of the latter are deeply uncomfortable with that) and 
2. not all women menstruate (e.g. post-menopausal women, intersex women, women who had hysterectomy, some women who are permanently on birth control, trans women) and that womanhood is not defined by this biological function. In fact, in sum,
[about half of the female population in the UK doesn't menstruate](https://www.menstrual-matters.com/maths-people/) [(archive link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112447/https://www.menstrual-matters.com/maths-people/).

The same goes for terms like "people with prostate" etc. If someone tried to force you stop using the word "woman" in the name of trans rights, tell them they're harming trans people with this since trans people want the exact opposite
of equating womanhood or manhood with biological functions. That person could be a misguided ally.

If they keep insisting on their point of view, even after you explained to them why they're mistaken,
they might be a troll trying to make trans people and their allies look insane or harmful. Warn others and then try to ignore them.

### "Trans people are not actually their gender identity because of different experiences/socialization."

This includes all kinds of arguments about early socialization and life experiences (e.g. mestruation). However what is commonly forgotten is that cis people also have a wide range of experiences with gender and that there are multiple
kinds of womanhood and manhood, both among cis and trans people:
- Some trans people are socialized as their gender identity from early on if they socially transition in childhood, while others aren't. Furthermore, socialization continues throughout life, so even trans people who transitioned later in life will have different life experiences from
cis people of their assigned gender who never transitioned socially.
- Some cis people grow up with strong enforcement of gender roles, others with less. Also applies to trans people.
- Some cis people grow up gnc as in relation to their assigned gender, others don't. Also applies to trans people.
- Some cis people grow up gay, others straight, others bi, ace, etc. changing their relationship with gender. Also applies to trans people.
- Some cis and trans people are intersex, others are not. Furthermore, there are a lot of different ways to be intersex, so some intersex people are mutilated because their intersex traits are noticed at birth while others don't even know themselves until, for example, karyotype testing is performed. 

All kinds of different combinations and experiences of woman- and manhood arise out of this, and there is no objective scale of womenliness/manliness of those womanhoods and manhoods.

Sure, a trans woman (with today's medicine) may never experience menstruation and the stigma around it, nor will she give birth, but neither will many intersex cis women. Furthermore, the experience of cis women with, for example, severe period cramps and irregular periods can't be compared to
cis women who have very light, painless, and predictable periods, or can take the pill permanently to stop menstruation with no noticable side effects. Women with bigger breasts also face some issues that women with smaller chests don't, e.g. fitting in certain clothes, back pain, finding a proper and affordable bra, exercising without pain, being stared at more, etc.
Yet nobody uses the lack of suffering of the latter groups to invalidate their gender identity -
why does this suddenly become a valid argument when used against trans women?

And why aren't the unique sufferings of trans womanhood (e.g. gender dysphoria, transmisogyny) acknowledged as qualifiers for 
womanhood as much as the sufferings unique to cis [endosex]( "not intersex") womanhood (e.g. giving birth, menstruation)? 
After all, it is only women (and some non-binary people) who can experience transmisogyny or gender dysphoria about the lack of breasts and hips.

The reverse is of course also true for trans men being recognized as men. Trans men are not men lite, and they are not _all_ automatically more feminist or less aggressive than _all_ cis men. Trans men can be just as toxic as some cis men, and cis men can be just as friendly or feminist as some trans men, because both groups can have various upbringings.

---
Finally, trans people's lives before social transition (if it occurs at all) are still very different from that of cis people of their assigned gender, because the former
is living in a closeted, inauthentic and thereby less productive and satisfying state. You wouldn't say that a gay/lesbian/bi person who was always 
straight-passing and lived in the closet for a long time period (if not their entire life) not a "real" gay/lesbian/bi person, because homophobia (and biphobia) still 
affected them in indirect ways (e.g. through witnessing and internalization). 

You would be correct to point out that their experience is different from someone
who was bullied since elementary school for appearing stereotypically queer (e.g. an effeminite boy), but that's a diffrent claim from the idea that there is only one true experience through which one becomes a "real" gay/lesbian/bi person.

Similarly, you are correct to point out that trans people tend to have different experiences with their gender than cis people of their gender identity - but
their experiences are also different from cis people of their assigned gender, and all this is not enough of an argument against still recognizing them (socially,
culturally, politically,...) as the gender of their gender identity.
