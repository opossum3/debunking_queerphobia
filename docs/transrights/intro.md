**Note**: Terminology for trans topics varies and changes a lot. There are plenty of websites, organizations, people, and scientific studies who use words slightly if not sometimes completely differently than this site does, so make sure you understand how others use terms when you interpret their studies, articles, etc.

## What is "transgender"?

**Transgender**, or trans for short, is an _adjective_ to describe people whose experienced, felt gender (**gender identity**) does not (fully, exclusively, and always) align with what they were assigned at birth. The opposite of it is called **cisgender** (i. e. everyone else, the majority of people).

</summary>

<section markdown="1">

> It's the same reason you don't say "Black and normal people" even when in a majority-white country: The word "normal" is used not just in a statistical, but also judging way by most people. Calling something "normal" implies the other is not normal, which implies it is sick, perverted, immoral, wrong, crazy, etc. **Saying "cis" de-stigmatizes trans people.**

> There's also a lesser chance of misunderstanding when saying "cis", because it's specific and accurate regardless of context and of who you're talking to. An example: When talking to a room full of trans people it'd be odd to refer to cis people (the minority within such a room, i.e. not the statistical norm) as "normal", especially if to most people in that room, being trans feels more normal than being cis (since they don't know anything else). **Saying "cis" makes sure everyone knows what you mean.**

</summary>
<section markdown="1">

> refers to the sex and consequentially gender identity that doctors thought a child would grow up to be at birth, usually based on the appearance of their external genitalia. 
> - For example, a baby is born with a penis, and the doctors assume that all the baby's internal organs, sex chromosomes, and their later hormonal development during puberty and self-perception do or will align with maleness.
> - It usually corresponds to the actual natal sex, which is why doctors do it this way. But that's not always the case, such as in the case of some [intersex people](!!!) who were (sometimes forcibly/surgically) assigned male or female rather than intersex at birth (AIAB) and raised accordingly. They can also be trans as in relation to what they were raised as, hence saying AGAB instead of natal sex in the definition of "transgender" is more accurate and inclusive of them. The terms AGAB and it's derivatives originated in the intersex community.

> 2. Body-related aspect (could also be called "sex identity"): What a person feels their bodies _ought_ to be like in terms of sex characteristics (e.g. chest, voice pitch, hairiness, etc.) (regardless of whether they already are or not).

There are different kinds of trans people:

<details>
	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **Binary** 
</summary>
<section markdown="1">

> A **trans man** is someone who has a male gender identity but was assigned something else at birth, i. e. either assigned female at birth (**AFAB**) or (much more rarely) assigned intersex at birth (**AIAB**). Most trans men use he/him pronouns.

> **FtM** (female-to-male) is an acronym often used as a synonym for trans men, but which is slightly controversial, as some trans men dislike it since it mentiones their assigned gender. Others on the other hand prefer the term FtM because it illustrates the journey they had to go through to arrive where they are.

> **Trans woman** and **MtF** are the corresponding versions of trans man and FtM but for **AMAB** (assigned male at birth) and AIAB people who have a female gender identity. Most trans women use she/her pronouns.

	</section>
</details>

<details>
	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **Non-binary** 
</summary>
<section markdown="1">

> A **non-binary person** is someone whose gender identity does not exclusively, fully, or always fall into the binary gender categories of male and female. In English, they tend to use they/them pronouns, more rarely neopronouns or it-pronouns (only use the latter if explicitly requested, as it is otherwise dehumanizing), some combination of, or all of them. They could have 
> - no gender identity (agender, genderless), 
> - only partly identify with a gender identity (demigender, e.g. demiboy/-girl), 
> - have an intermediate gender identity (neutrois), 
> - a combination of the binary genders (multigender, bigender, pangender,...), 
> - a third gender outside the male-female spectrum (e.g. maverique) 
> - or their gender identity might be repeadetly changing between a set group of various gender identities (genderfluid).

**Transmasculine** is a broader term that includes all AFAB trans people who have (to whatever extent) a more masculine gender identity than assigned, and **transfeminine** is the corresponding term for AMAB people. They include binary as well as non-binary trans people.

	</section>
</details>

**A person does not choose to have a certain gender identity**, despite what the phrase "identifying (with something)" might make it sound like. Both cis and trans people just have it, it just _is_ a certain way. At best, a person might choose how specifically they put their identity into words (especially when it comes to the nuances of non-binary gender identities) - but the feelings leading to that are not chosen or controlled.

**People (including trans people) should be referred to/gendered according to their gender identity** (unless it puts them in danger, e.g. it would out a trans person to someone who they don't want to know they are trans yet). 
By this you are showing that you acknowledge that the person probably knows themselves much better than you do and respect their autonomy on this, and this should be done even if you dislike the person overall or have a disagreement. Don't use misgendering as an insult, you're more creative than that.

## Is _this_ gender identity?

Here is a list of things which gender identity or being trans is associated with, but is **not** synonymous with and should **not** be confused with:

<details> 
	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **Gender roles/expectations** 
</summary>
<section markdown="1">
> What society expects of people who it perceives as a certain sex is seperate from what a person feels they are ought to be perceived as.
	</section>
	</details>

<details>
	<summary markdown="1">  ‣ **Gender expression** 
</summary>
<section markdown="1">

> This refers to various expressions that are gendered in a given society, such as certain clothes, hairstyles, behaviors, and body traits of a person. A person often uses them, as far as they can voluntary choose them, to signify their gender identity to the world. E. g. a woman wears a dress to signify that she is a woman.

> However, this doesn't always have to be the case, e.g. a woman wears short hair even though the society she lives in regards this as a masculine gender expression. She doesn't stop being a woman due to this, since she does this not because she wants to express that she is a man, but because she just likes it better this way and either sees it as a genderless act (hence wears it regardless of her gender identity), a rebellion against gender roles, or because she has a different view/concept of her womanhood that includes aspects others regard as masculine.

> A gender expression that does not align with society's expectations for gender expressions of one's gender identity can be described as **gender non-conforming (gnc)**. This is _not_ a gender identity, but a descriptor of gender expression as it relates to a person's gender identity in the context of a given society.

> Just like cis people can be gnc (i. e. cis man wears a dress, cis woman wears short hair), so can trans people (i. e. trans man wears a dress, trans woman wears short hair). None of them stop being their gender identity just for being gnc.
	</section>
</details>

<details>
	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **Crossdressing** (which is sometimes also called "transvestism")
</summary>
<section markdown="1">

> Crossdressing is the act of wearing clothes, hairstyles, make-up, etc. that a given society typically associates with a different (usually binary) gender identity than one's own. It can in some sense be seen as an extreme form of gnc. 

> Drag performers are a specific subset of crossdressers that exaggerate and parody gender roles for entertainment or critique.

> **Crossdressing differs fundamentally from being trans** in that a crossdresser does so for the sake of entertainment, while a trans person "crossdresses" as in relation to their assigned gender to express their authentic self. Calling a trans person a crossdresser even though they always dress in a conforming way _in relation to their gender identity_ is insulting because it implies their trans identity is a joke, entertainment, in a word, disingenuous.
	</section>
</details>

<details>
	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ _But don't trans people frequently crossdress before realizing they're trans? I have a friend who looks gnc or crossdresses and I suspect they are trans and just don't know it yet. What do I do?_
</summary>
<section markdown="1">

> It's true that trans people often look like cis gnc people or even experiment with crossdressing before they realize they're trans and/or let you know.
But please do not pressure a seemingly cis gnc person you know to tell you whether they are trans or not.

> If they are trans they would tell you when they feel ready, don't put them on the spot or put pressure on them.
And if they aren't trans, the question becomes redundant.
The majority of people who are gnc as in relation to their assigned gender are not trans, and not all trans people are gnc as in relation to their assigned gender before they come out.

> If you see a gnc cis person and worry that they are actually trans, but just haven't realized yet because they don't know trans people exist: Casually bring up the topic of trans 
people and the possibilities of transition (see below) without making any connections or references to them personally. This
way you can be sure they know trans people and the option to transition exists, as well as signalling that you'd be accepting of them if they came out to you, all without putting them on the spot.

	</section>
</details>
<br>
<details>
	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ **Sexual orientation**
</summary>
<section markdown="1">

> Sexual orientation describes what gender(s) a person is typically sexually and/or romantically able to be attracted to, not who they see themselves as. Gender identity and sexual orientation are seperate aspects of a person's self.

> A cis man can love another man without this meaning that he must be a woman or must become a woman. The same goes for trans men: A trans man can be attracted exclusively to other men, whithout this meaning he's not "really trans" or a straight woman after all.

> Upon hearing this, some might be confused as to why someone would want to become a man if this makes him gay/he stops being heterosexual. After all, if a gay trans man continued to live as woman, he would be perceived heterosexual by others and this would have made life much easier. 

> This confusion comes from the misunderstanding that trans people are transitioning for the sake of others or for an easier life, e.g. to "become" heterosexual as their new gender and thereby please society, to "fix" their homosexuality that they would have if they lived as their assigned gender. 

> In reality, trans people transition first and foremost out of a need for authenticity that all people have to some degree. A gay trans man transitions simply because that's just who he truly is, he has no choice in the matter just like cis people do not choose their orientation. He feels alienated from the idea of himself as a woman (who only happens to be straight), while living his life as a man (who happens to be gay) feels most authentic. That authenticity means more to him than the prejudices of the world.

> The same applies to lesbian trans women and straight trans people: The latter do not transition to escape homosexuality, but to achieve authenticity (which happens to not include homosexuality, but that's of secondary importance).

> Trans people can also be bisexual, asexual, or aromantic.

	</section>
</details>
<br>

All this can be summarized the following way: If a cis person can do something without this meaning that their gender identity is illegitimate, so can a trans person.
- Cis person can be gay? Trans person can also be gay.
- Cis person can crossdress or be a drag performer? Trans person can also crossdress (as in relation to their gender identity, e.g. a trans woman wears a suit) or be a drag performer.
- Cis person can disregard gender roles? Trans person can also disregard gender roles.
- Cis person can grow up mostly playing with people of another gender? Trans person can also grow up mostly playing with people of another gender (than their gender identity, i.e. when they lived as a girl as a child they mostly played with other girls but then grew up to be trans men).

## But how do people know?

Some readers might be confused now as to how trans people _know_ their gender identity, how they can "feel like" a man, woman, or something else. This isn't surprising, because most people are cis, and most of them therefore never had a mismatch between their gender identity, assigned gender, and bodies.

In general, many people don't know they have a need until it is not fulfilled, e.g. a hypothetical person who has never felt hunger probably doesn't even realize they _need_ food and aren't eating it just for fun. Similarly, most cis people never felt gender incongruence and therefore don't even realize they are capable of feeling it, that they too have a _need_ to feel congruent with their body and how others perceive them. This leads some to ignorantly say that they aren't cis or don't have a gender identity, unintentionally sounding like agender people (who are part of the trans community).

The feelings that lead trans people to deduct that their gender identity is different from the one that they were assigned can be described as follows:
- **Gender incongruence** is a feeling of alienation from one's own sex characteristics and/or gendered name, pronouns, and/or honorifics.
- **Gender dysphoria** is distress caused by gender incongruence.
- **Gender euphoria** is joy or relief caused by relieving gender icongruence.

In trans circles, people sometimes like to split each of these up into a social and body-related aspect, just like gender identity itself, as already explained earlier.

Cis people can also experience gender incongruence, which is what makes us able to conclude and empirically prove that cis people also have a gender identity - they just, like the person who was never hungry, never notice it since it's never in conflict with anything.

> **Note**: The way this site uses the term gender incongruence and gender dysphoria is more colloquial/loose than the diagnoses of the same names, but in a similar vein. The main difference is that the diagnoses require for the feeling to cause clinically significant distress over a long enough period of time.
> 
> A diagnosis of gender incongruence (ICD-11) or gender dysphoria (DSM-V), or any of the diagnoses that preceeded these ("transsexualism" in the ICD-10 or "gender identity disorder" in the DSM-IV) are commonly required to acces medical transiion (see below). 

Trans people can realize they are trans at any age. Some of the reasons why someone might realize they are trans later than sooner are 
- not knowing trans people exist or that transition is possible
- repression and compensation (purposefully conforming to the gender roles of one's assigned gender)
- trouble accepting one's sexual orientation as the new gender

---

## What do they do about it?

Trans people usually, if their circumstances allow it and it doesn't clash with any of their beliefs, **transition** in order to relieve gender incongruence, especially gender dysphoria, and achieve gender euphoria. 

There are various ways in which one can transition:
- **Legal transition** means changing one's legal name and/or legal gender marker.
- **Social transition** means using a different name, pronouns, honorifics etc. in everyday social life. This often involves coming out to people who have known the trans person from before their social transition/as their old gender.
- **Medical transition** means changing one's sex characteristics as far as desired or medically possible to align more with one's gender identity. Parts of this are irreversible. It can include:
	- (Cross-sex) **Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)**: Anti-androgens and estrogen (sometimes also progesterone) for transfeminine people and testosterone (sometimes also birth control) for transmasculine people.
	- **Sex-reassignment surgery (SRS)**, which can include
		- **Bottom surgery**: Surgery on the genitals
		- **Top surgery**: Surgery on the chest (double mastectomy/removal of breasts for transmasculine people or breast augmentation for transfeminine people)
		- Facial surgery, vocal chord surgery, removal of reproductive organs, clavicle shortening or lengthening, and liposuction in specific places - surgeries which don't have nicknames in trans communities like the other two.

Just like cis people, trans people can have very different understandings of and relationships with their gender identity and expression, have different priorities, and can therefore experience gender incongruence, dysphoria, and euphoria differently. Naturally, their paths will be different and transitions can also look very different.

This doesn't make any trans person "more trans" than another, just like cis people having different relationships with their gender identities doesn't make any one of them "more cis" than another.

<details>
	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ An example: 
</summary>
<section markdown="1">

> To one trans man, the most important aspect of his manhood can be getting genital surgery, but he's okay with having a larger chest because he sees breasts as gender neutral. Another might be asexual and apathetic to his genitals, so going through the trouble of bottom surgery is just not worth it for him, but might care a lot about his sillhouette and seek out top surgery as fast as possible. A third trans man might be content with just hormones, because a deeper voice is the only central part of his manhood, while another might want all available procedures and still not be content due to the limitations of current trans medicine. 

> In the same fashion, there are cis men who are more or less hairy, care more or less about their chest or beards or voice pitch, etc. There are even some that would be fine with having different genitalia or would even prefer it if it makes their sexual lives easier/less messy, and some that are jealous of the ability to give birth.

> The same also applies to women and non-binary people, of course. 

	</section>
</details>

A **detransitioner** is someone who first transitioned in some way (legal, social, and/or medical) but then reversed these changes (temporarily or permanently). Possible reasons for this include:
- social discrimination (housing, employment, family, friends) - in this case the detransition is likely to be temporary, they often hope to **retransition** when it is safer
- financial means (e.g. cannot afford HRT anymore) - likely to retransition
- reproduction - likely to retransition
- realizing they are non-binary instead of binary trans and partially "detransitioning" (not all agree using this term for this)
- realizing they are not trans at all - usually permanent detransition (= cis detrans people)

Detransition should not be confused with regret. A transitioned person can regret a certain part of transition due to surgical complications, loosing friends, etc., but still be trans and not permanently detransition. On the other hand, there are some cis detrans people who see their experience of transition and detransition as having been necessary steps for them to grow.

## Misc terms

<details>
	<summary markdown="1"> ‣ Some other terms not yet mentioned that you might come across when discussing trans people and transition:
</summary>
<section markdown="1">

- **Passing (as something)** means someone is initially perceived as something by others. For example, someone who passes as a man is someone who people assume is a man upon meeting and interacting.
- (Going) **stealth** means living a life where nobody or very few, close people know that you are trans. You don't reveal it to people and are no longer frequently around those who knew you from before your social transition.
- Some synonyms for AGAB:
	- Designated gender at birth (DGAB)
	- Gender assigned at birth (GAAB)
	- Gender designated at birth (GDAB)
- Some synonyms for SRS:
	- gender-confirmation surgery (GCS) - Probably the most popular one besides SRS.
	- gender-affirming surgery (GAS) - Has a rather... unfortunate acronym.
	- gender-reassignment surgery (GRS) - Very unpopular among trans people and inaccurate, since a person's gender doesn't change with surgery, their sex characteristics do.
	- sex change operation (very colloquial)
	- sex realignment surgery (rarely used)

## And what is the purpose of all this?

The purpose of this section of the site is to provide evidence for the validity of the presented narrative and refuting misconceptions and opposing anti-trans narratives, 
such as those advocating for a banning or heavy restriction of medical and legal transition, justifying it through fearmongering about the dangers of "gender ideology" that is supposedly "denying biological reality". 

This will hopefully, help achieving better living conditions for (especially working class) trans people, such as better healthcare, less discrimination in employment and housing, and less people disowning their trans relatives (especially those that depend on them financially, such as children, teens, and young adults).
