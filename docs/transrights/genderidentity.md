## "Trans people are delusional."

I will use the word "delusion" to refer to a strong belief in something that is contrary to empirical evidence.
This claim usually comes from one of the following beliefs/assumptions:

1. That trans people claim they **are** the other sex when they clearly aren't, and that's delusional because it's denying their physiological reality.
2. That gender identity doesn't exist _at all_, so claiming that it is at odds with one's sex is delusional because it is claiming the existence of something (gender identity) that isn't there. Sex characteristics alone determine what you are.
3. That gender identity exists, but it can never be misaligned with one's sex characteristics and hence one's assigned sex, so claiming that there is a misalignment is delusional because such a misalignment is impossible. 

All of these are untrue.

### "Trans people claim they are a different sex."
Trans people are **not** claiming they **are** entirely the other sex physically, they are claiming they have a gender identity that tells them that they _ought_ to have different sex characteristics (body-related gender incongruence) or perception of them by others (social gender incongruence) _than they currently do_, or used to have if they already transitioned. This is what is called gender identity.

In fact, trans people live every single day of their lives with this reality. Trans people wouldn't even call themselves trans if they were actually delusional and thought they already are and always have been physically the sex they wish they were, they would simply call themselves cis people of their gender identity. The very definition of "transgender" acknowledges the existence of sex characteristics and assigned sex.

Going up to a trans person and saying "but you're biologically/partially still X" is rude not only because it's in most (not all) contexts none of your concern and because it can cause unnecessary and unproductive distress (gender dysphoria), but also because it is condescending: **You're implying the person doesn't already know this and needs you to tell them that.**

### "Gender identity doesn't exist"

#### Gender identity proven by cis people

Most cis people openly state that they feel they do have a gender identity:
- A study by [Joel. et. al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19419899.2013.830640) ([pdf link](https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/daphnajoel/files/2014/11/Joel_gender_identity_2013.pdf), [archive link of the pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20210425120153/https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/daphnajoel/files/2014/11/Joel_gender_identity_2013.pdf)) surveyed Israeli cis individuals of various sexual orientations as well as trans people and observed that most cis people also have a sense of gender identity, even though it also found ambiguous feelings towards gender to be more common among cis people and less correlated to sexual orientation than often presumed. 
	- The results have been replicated in [Joel & Jacobson (2018)](doi.org/10.1007/s10508-018-1239-y) and [Joel & Jacobson (2019)]( https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2018.1523998) with English-speaking participants.
	- This also provides evidence that cis people's relationships with gender significantly vary within the group, like with trans people, though not to the same degree. The latter fact might well be due to social circumstances rather than to innate differences between trans and cis gender identities.

If gender identity didn't exist, no cis person would ever feel anything comparable to gender incongruence or gender dysphoria if they live or appear as a different gender than assigned, and yet they do.

- Amanda Bynes is an actress who starred in the 2006 movie "She's the man" as a girl who impersonates her twin brother. She says this was "a super strange and out-of-body experience" which even caused her depression. ([Ahlgrim, 2018](https://www.insider.com/amanda-bynes-paper-magazine-interview-depression-shes-the-man-2018-11) - URL excluded from Wayback Machine). This indicates she has a female gender identity that prevents her from comfortably appearing and living as male, and since she was AFAB, she is therefore a cis woman.
- Norah Vincent went undercover as a man for a year to write a book called "Self-Made Man". The book itself and it's conclusions has many immense flaws, [as many reviews will let you know](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29434.Self_Made_Man). But the reason for mentioning this is that she ended up so depressed and out of touch with reality (gender dysphoria) [that she checked herself in into a psychiatric hospital.](http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1868983,00.html) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200219104300/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1868983,00.html))

Sometimes cis, endosex (=not intersex) people loose sex characteristics or gain certain ones typically associated with the other sex. 

Yet instead of accepting their new bodies, they feel the need to adjust their bodies back (possibly for both internal or societal reasons) and feel distressed otherwise (gender dysphoria). This indicates that there is a gender identity that prevents them from the first option that should in theory - if there really was no gender identity - be much easier.

- PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) causes higher testosterone levels, a lack of periods, and/or enlarged ovaries. If gender identity doesn't exist, women with this syndrome should feel no distress over sometimes having masculine features, such as increased body and facial hair. Yet according to a qualitative study of 23 reproductive aged women by [Amiri et. al. in 2014](doi.org/10.5812/ircmj.12423), they do.
- Cis men who loose their genitalia or some of it's functions in war, due to accidents, violent partners, or having an intersex trait should all feel 0 remorse over loosing their/lacking genitals if there was no gender identity. And yet they do feel distress and [phalloplasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalloplasty) is a surgery that was invented for them specifically and is today only additionally used for trans men.
- Some cis people mistakenly believe they are trans and medically transition, but then realize it alienated them further from their bodies. This indicates that they originally had a gender identity that has now been misaligned with their bodies artificially and of which they cannot simply get rid of or ignore to be comfortable in their new, transitioned bodies. They usually detransition. _(Note, however, [that this number of people is really low](!!!), in most representative studies way less than 1%.)_

#### Gender identity proven by forcibly re-assigned people

In some cases, children are surgically re-assigned to another sex before they can even give consent and even without medical necessity. They are raised almost entirely as their new gender. This harmful practice is often perfomed on visibly intersex children.

Despite this socialization, they are much more likely to later transition back to their first assigned sex due to feeling wrong in their re-assigned sex (gender incongruence). This indicates that there is an innate gender identity that they are unable to just let go of, instead preferring an adjustment of their bodies to it.

- [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) was an [endosex](! "not intersex") cis man who underwent genital mutilation at 22 months to re-assign him and raise as female, after his (nonconsensual and medically unnecessary) circumcision went wrong. He ended up depressed as a girl and transitioned to male.
- Male newborns who are born with not fully formed or functional male genitalia experience a similar fate as David Reimer. They tend to transition back to male much more often than those who are born and assigned female right away:
	- In a study of 16 subjects, 2 were assigned and raised as male, while the other 14 were re-assigned and raised as female due to a condition affecting the pelvis in
		genetic males. But 8 out of those 14 ended up identifying themselves as male during the course of the study, one had an unclear identity, and only 5 seemed to be happy living as female (with no knowledge that they were born male). ([Reiner and Gearhart, 2004](doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa022236))
	- A review of 3 conditions affecting male genitalia also "clearly indicate[s] an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood", although it also notes that the findings "are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens." ([Meyer-Bahlburg 2005](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9)).
		- This means that there might also be a genetic, epigenetic, and/or social factor in determining gender identity. Or it could also mean that gender identity is less exact of a concept as presumed by the term "core gender identity"; that there is some space for variability in the way people interpret/formulate similar feelings of gender incongruence into gender identity.

#### Recognition by institutions

Gender identity is also recognized as a real, existing trait that can be different from sex and likely unchangable trait/experience by the following reputable institutions and organizations (not an exhaustive list):

While this does not automatically mean this position must be right - simply appealing to authority is not enough -, I have already explained some of the scientific basis of these assertions previously in this section.

For those believing that there is a conspiracy in the medical field to trans all the children because medical transition gives someone a financial gain, making the statements of any medical authority unreliable, [see here](!!!).

### "Gender identity can't be naturally misaligned with sex."
Some might argue that in all the examples given above, people are born with the correct body for their gender identity and are _then_ misaligned through surgeries or illness. But it would not yet prove that it is possible a person is _born_ with a body and gender identity that are misaligned.

But if trans people weren't truly one gender trapped in the body of another and their distress was due to something other than that, then it follows that medical and social transition - which aligns their gender identity with outer factors - 
[couldn't be as effective as it is at minimizing gender incongruence and the accompanying dysphoria](!!!). 

In fact, there should not only be no improvement if one's gender identity always naturally aligned with one's sex characteristics - there should be a worsening, because now it is being artificially _misaligned_ while the supposed actual cause of the distress that was wrongly labeled _gender_ dysphoria still wasn't addressed. Yet this isn't what we see happening in reality, so this theory must be false based on empirical data.

## "Where do we draw the line?" - Slippery slope argument

### Transage

"Transage" is a concept where a person identifies as and wants to socially be recognized as a different age than they are chronologically and legally. The difference to transgender identity is two-fold:

First, **age and sex are fundamentally different:**

- Age is a measurement of a certain history of a person, i.e. "I am 58 years old" means "My birth was 58 years ago." "Transage" would require a person to change an event of the past, i. e. the date of their birth and all past experiences.
- Sex describes the state of an organism capable of playing a certain role in sexual reproduction (male, female, or none). The theoretical concept of a full sex change does not require changing the past, it only requires the changing of a present state/ability, namely reproductive function.

Claiming to be a different chronological age is more akin to someone claiming a different gender history than they actually had than to trans people merely transitioning. It's more like a trans woman genuinely (not for safety reasons or similar) insisting she is a cis woman, not like a trans woman merely existing.

Second, **the intentions of transgender and self-identified "transage" people are fundamentally different:**

The term was originally coined with maliscious intent by pedophiles and other minor-attracted persons (MAPs) so that they could self-identify as minors and argue that they are capable of dating and having sexual contact with minors in a non-abusive, consensual way. Transgender people's desire to transition to be more authentic is not comparable to a MAP seeking justifications for their paraphilia that is inherently harmful to everyone involved.

Is it possible to "feel" like a different age than one chronologically and legally is? Definitely, psychological age is a well-established concept and can differ from chronological age due to a variety of factors.

**But does it make sense to compare such people to transgender peopl0e** and to change their legal birthdays for example ("legal age-transition")? No, there is no benefit for their psychological development or society. 

Does it make sense to medically intervene to try make people's bodies "younger"? Yes, we already do so, but not because someone identifies a certain way, but rather because we're trying to make people live longer lives. There are neither social/legal nor medical parallels to be drawn between transgender experience and psychological age discrepancies.
